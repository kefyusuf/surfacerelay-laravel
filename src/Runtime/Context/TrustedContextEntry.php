 * a requirement is represented by the absence of its entry, never by a
 * present entry holding null; this keeps resolved-empty states (e.g. an
 * empty current selection) distinguishable from "not resolved".
 *
 * `confirmationScopeKey` is optional stable trusted adapter identity for
 * deterministic confirmation scoping. The key does not grant authority by
 * itself and is never sourced from generic caller input/metadata.
